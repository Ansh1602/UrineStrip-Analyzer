# Urine Strip Analyzer Frontend

This is the frontend part of the Urine Strip Analyzer application, built with React. The frontend allows users to upload images of urine strips, which are then sent to the backend for processing. The backend returns the RGB values of specific colors on the strip, which are then displayed on the frontend.
